## Restore accidentally deleted files from Amazon S3

### When should you use this script?

These scripts were developed to help users restore files that have been accidentally deleted from Amazon S3. 

- Restore files from all buckets:

    [This script](https://github.com/aws-samples/restore-s3-deleted-objects/blob/main/revive_s3_objects_from_all_buckets.py) iterates through all of the files in all of the buckets in an AWS account. If the files have been deleted after a specific point in time (*point_of_restore*), then the script restores the files to their latest state.

- Restore files from one specific bucket:

    [This script](https://github.com/aws-samples/restore-s3-deleted-objects/blob/main/revive_s3_objects_from_1_bucket.py) iterates through all of the files in a specific bucket in an AWS account. If the files have been deleted after a specific point in time (*point_of_restore*), then the script restores the files to their latest state.

### Pre-requirements
1) **Attention!** In order for this script to work, [versioning ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/Versioning.html) must have been enabled in the Amazon S3 bucket **before** the files were deleted.
1) Edit the chosen script to set the *point_of_restore* variable. This should represent the date and time of the incident. Make sure to round down, so we don't miss any files.
1) If you chose the script that restores from one specific bucket, set the name of the bucket (*bucket_name*) as well
1) If you need a list of all of the objects restored, set *list_all_restored_objects* to True
1) If you feel more comfortable running Jupyter Notebooks, a .ipynb file has also been provided.
